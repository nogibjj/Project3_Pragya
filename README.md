# Project3
##Generate a script that queries a database: MySQL, Sqlite, Spark or a cloud system.

The objective of this project are :

1. To build a notes taking application using Sqlite
2. To Query the database by building an interactive app using streamlit. 

SQlite:
Python SQLite3 module is used to integrate the SQLite database with Python. It provides a straightforward and simple-to-use interface for interacting with SQLite databases. There is no need to install this module separately as it comes along with Python after the 2.5x version.

Streamlit: 
Streamlit is an open source app framework in Python language. It helps us create web apps for data science and machine learning in a short time. It is compatible with major Python libraries such as scikit-learn, Keras, PyTorch, SymPy(latex), NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib etc.
